    Hi there! I'm Danny and I'm in my first semester at the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY. Iâ€™m coming into the field as a career changer after 15+ years in the nonprofit space, with a focus on working with immigrant communities across education, case management and legal access programs. I'm interested in local stories, investigative reporting and longform narratives, as well as using data to help tell a story. Among other topics, I hope to explore the experiences of recently arrived and more settled immigrant communities in New York City, particularly how folks from different backgrounds interact and relate with one another, or try to, as well as looking at the physical spaces where these interactions happen/could happen.
